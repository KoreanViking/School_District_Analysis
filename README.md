# School_District_Analysis

# Summary

The purpose of this analysis was to take student data from different schools, and break down the information. We first took in the data, and cleaned it by removing any duplicated or null value cells. From there we continued to clean the data by changing columns like Grade into an int. Next we summarized the data by displaying certain critera. One piece of information that stuck out to me was the comparison of Charter and Public Schools. In the chart we can see that Charter schools typically tested higher in every grade except for 12th grade.
